# movie_reviews
The insights from this project take a look at why certain movies ratings from these movie review companies are very inflated compared to others. I used the pandas library along with matplotlib to run statistical tests, create histograms, and scatter plots. 

The plots reveal lapses in data due to existing partnerships between critics and production companies.
